            Nikita Mazepin might be bringing a healthy chunk of budget with him
            to the Haas team, but don’t be fooled into thinking he hasn’t also
            got the driving chops to go with it. The Russian – the fourth to
            compete in F1 after Vitaly Petrov, Sergey Sirotkin and Daniil Kvyat
            – has an impressive CV in the junior formulas, finishing runner-up
            in the 2018 GP3 championship with four race wins. And after taking
            his time to find his feet in his first season of F2 in 2019, he came
            into his own in 2020, notching up six podiums – including two
            victories – on his way to fifth in the standings. Haas boss Guenther
            Steiner has described Mazepin as a “mature racer” and he is likely
            to need all that maturity in 2021 as he drives for the American team
            in motorsport’s top tier.

            He is the son of Dmitry Mazepin, who is the core shareholder and
            chairman of the Uralchem Integrated Chemicals Company. On 9 December
            2020, Mazepin posted an Instagram story in which he appeared to
            inappropriately grope a woman's breasts. In a statement, the Haas F1
            Team rebuked Mazepin's actions and called the video "abhorrent".
            Mazepin also released an apology, stating "I have to hold myself to
            a higher standard as a Formula 1 driver and I acknowledge I have let
            myself and many people down", but the apology was deleted nine days
            later. In March 2021, Mazepin reiterated that he understood his
            actions were wrong. The woman in the video defended Mazepin and
            labelled his actions as a joke between the two. The woman has since
            posted content on her own social media stating "never let them touch
            you again or be disrespectful to you" and the two have since
            unfollowed each other. The controversy led to the hashtag
            "#WeSayNoToMazepin" to trend on Twitter, calling for Mazepin's
            removal from the Haas F1 Team.

            Following an incident between the drivers over qualifying etiquette
            on Saturday, Mazepin and Schumacher had a near-miss during Sunday’s
            Dutch Grand Prix in the opening stages. As Schumacher looked to pass
            Mazepin on the right-hand side as they started the second lap,
            Mazepin moved across late, forcing Schumacher to back out.
            Schumacher also picked up a bit of front wing damage after touching
            Mazepin’s wheel, forcing him into an early pit stop. It was not the
            first time that Mazepin had made a late move on the main straight
            against Schumacher, having done similar at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix
            in June. Schumacher said after the race that he felt “very angry”
            about Mazepin’s move when it happened, but opted against voicing his
            thoughts over team radio.
